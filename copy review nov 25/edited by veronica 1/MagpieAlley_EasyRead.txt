Magpie Alley, a short passage off Bouverie Street in EC4.
It showcases the history of Fleet Street. 

The 60-foot-long alley features a wall covered with ceramic tiles showing printers, printing offices, and historic events from Fleet Street’s past. 

The information display is a good place to visit.
