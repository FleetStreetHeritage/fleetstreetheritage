Clifford’s Inn, originally founded in 1344 as an Inn of Chancery, provided early legal education before students moved on to the Inns of Court. It survived longer than most other Inns, continuing as a professional association with residential accommodation even after educational functions ended in 1642. After the Great Fire of London in 1666, the Fire Court operated there to settle rebuilding disputes.
Over the centuries, Clifford’s Inn hosted residents in diverse professions, had literary connections including Dickens and the Woolfs, and served as headquarters for various societies such as The Art-Workers’ Guild and The Society of Women Journalists. By the early 20th century, the buildings had deteriorated, and the site was sold in 1934. Most of the original structures were demolished, except for the gatehouse, and an eight-storey mansion block with flats and offices was built on the site.
