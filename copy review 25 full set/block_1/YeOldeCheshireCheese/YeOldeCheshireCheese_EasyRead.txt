Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese, one of London’s most famous historic pubs, is tucked away off Fleet Street in Wine Office Court, with a history reaching back before the Great Fire of 1666 and possibly even to a Carmelite monastery. It is most strongly associated with the 18th century, particularly Dr Samuel Johnson, who frequently visited the pub, along with other literary figures like Oliver Goldsmith and Charles Dickens, who used it as a workplace and novel setting.
Renowned for its cozy, conversation-filled atmosphere, the pub attracted generations of writers, thinkers, and famous personalities, including Tennyson, Conan Doyle, Voltaire, Mark Twain, and many Fleet Street journalists. Its enduring charm lies in its historic interior, welcoming fireside seating, hearty food, and traditional drinks, preserving a lively cultural and social hub into the 21st century.
