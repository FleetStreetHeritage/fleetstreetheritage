Ashentree Court, a short alley off Whitefriars Street, has historical significance with information panels on Northcliffe House and the crypt of Whitefriars Monastery. The surrounding streets evolved through the 18th and 19th centuries, with Whitefriars Street and Bouverie Street adjusting to create more direct routes.
Northcliffe House, designed by Ellis and Clarke and built in 1925–27, was purpose-built to house the Daily Mail under Lord Northcliffe’s Associated Newspapers. Its steel-frame construction with concrete cladding facilitated heavy printing operations, which continued there until the late 1980s. The building influenced subsequent newspaper architecture and was granted Listed Building Status in 1988, preserving its historic façade during redevelopment in 1999–2001. The site also commemorates the migration of printing south of Fleet Street, drawn by gas and water utilities, and documents the history of London’s newspaper industry.
