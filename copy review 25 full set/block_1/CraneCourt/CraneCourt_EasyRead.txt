Crane Court, a modest-looking alley off Fleet Street, has a surprisingly rich history. Its entrance was near the Fetter Lane gallows, which stood from 1590 to 1723. In the early 18th century, Sir Isaac Newton and colleagues walked the court to reach the Royal Society’s premises, which remained there for seven decades.
The court was also linked to political controversy, such as the harassment of printer Dryden Leach for associating with reformer John Wilkes. In the 19th century, Crane Court became a hub for publishing: Punch Magazine launched in 1841, followed by the Illustrated London News in 1842, pioneering photo-journalism. Today, historical traces like a small orrery over the archway commemorate its scientific and publishing heritage, reflecting its hidden significance despite its unassuming appearance.
