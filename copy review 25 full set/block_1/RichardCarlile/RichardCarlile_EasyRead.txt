Richard Carlile (1790–1843) was born in Devon and trained as a tinsmith before moving to London in 1813. Influenced by radical ideas and the writings of Tom Paine, he became a publisher, selling pamphlets and founding the radical newspaper The Republican in 1817. Carlile’s paper promoted parliamentary reform and criticized the Church, gaining popularity but attracting government persecution.
He was imprisoned in 1819 for blasphemy and seditious libel, yet continued writing while his wife Jane, and later his sister Mary, helped run the paper, which grew in circulation despite government attempts to suppress it through taxes and prosecutions. Carlile later championed women’s rights and published works advocating sexual emancipation. Repeated imprisonments and financial hardship marked his later life, but his activism contributed significantly to press freedom. He died in 1843, remembered for his pivotal role in advancing freedom of expression.
