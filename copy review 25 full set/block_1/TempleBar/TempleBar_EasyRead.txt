The Roman-built City Wall in Londinium once enclosed the Square Mile, with access controlled by gates. The main ceremonial gate at Fleet Street, known as Temple Bar, dates back to at least 1293. Rebuilt after the Great Fire of 1666 by Thomas Knight and Joshua Marshall, it featured statues of monarchs and an upper chamber later used for banking records.
In 1878, Temple Bar was dismantled to widen Fleet Street, with stones stored in South London. Lady Meux later had it rebuilt at Theobalds Park in 1889, hosting grand events attended by notable figures including Edward VII and Winston Churchill. The M25 later restricted access, and the structure fell into decay until it was returned to the City of London in 2004, re-erected at the entrance to Paternoster Square. The upper chamber is now leased to the Worshipful Company of Chartered Architects for use as a headquarters and educational space under the Temple Bar Trust.
