Early printing involved arranging individual letters, or type, by hand into lines using a composing stick, then transferring them to a locked forme for inking and pressing onto paper. Type was made by typefounders, with the Caslon family in London being the most famous. William Caslon the Elder began producing popular, highly readable type around 1730, used in notable works like the first printed US Declaration of Independence. Later generations of Caslons continued the craft, with William Caslon IV creating the first sans-serif type, commemorated in Red Lion Court.
